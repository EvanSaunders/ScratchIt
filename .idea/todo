delete card is broken
make sure card in userfields matches card in Card
possibly revise card creation, make it easier, one card at a time, just put text in circle, no winner or loser
viewSentCards: presing copy puts a check on every one, dark mode wonky in text boxes, show winner keep?, make userfields redirect to viewcards page
make "you have no active cards"
fix dark mode flash when loading
make hamburger menu work when page is zoomed in
fix white line under userFields if the card has mb-
make login page look good
